# ipfs-container-demos

This repository outlines demos for container + infrastructure things done with ipfs: booting VMs, docker-registry, mounting data volumes, etc.

## Planning a Demo

1. create an issue with the demo title
2. outline what the demo would be / do
3. outline what artifacts we would need (vms, makefiles, etc) 
4. discuss


## Preparing a Demo

1. create demo artifacts
2. make a directory in the repo (e.g. "boot-vm-with-pxe")
3. put all artifacts in there
4. make sure to add a `Makefile` that builds + fetches things with ipfs
5. if there are specific ipfs urls to pin, note those and where to get them.
6. write the demo `script` (what to say, what to do, etc)

## Making demo

**We can worry about this later, once we have 5+ demos ready to record.**

1. record demo
2. upload to youtube on ipfs account
3. write a demo page -- like an [ipfs-example](https://github.com/protocol/ipfs-examples) but embedding the youtube video + transcript
4. publish to ipfs examples page, blog, twitter, etc.
